InfPer,7,4,16,Derp,Infectious period,Days,"Shortened from these estimates since they were from hosp cases. I think this PMID 32125362 is actually 12 median (1-24 range), so shortened a little more.

This paper (PMID: 32113505) conceptualizes superspreading as different community and ""household"" secondary attack rates. This paper (PMID: 12766206) tries to estimate the reproductive number excluding superspreaders, because they argue that we don't know how to influence either the prob of being a superspreader or the number that they will infect.

fDocVisit,0.5,0.3,0.7,Derp,Fraction of symptomatic who will visit the doctor,Unitless,"Josh: HIVE PMID: 24907381, Flu A 30%, Flu B 43%. I wouldn't be surprised if higher for COVID though. M: that said, with 80% showing mild/moderate symptoms it's hard to say. LB is given by saying only severe go and then using flu rates (0.2*0.3 = 0.06), while UB is an assumption supposing that people are worried about COVID and go pretty often"
